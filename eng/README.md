# FizzBuzz (Scripting - 30m)

## Scenario
Write a program that counts using an index (variable) from 1 to n, where n is a parameter passed to the program. Depending on what the value of the index is, this program does one of the following:
- If the index is a multiple of 3, the program should print “Fizz”
- If the index is a multiple of 5, the program should print “Buzz”
- If the index is both a multiple of 3 and 5, the program should print “FizzBuzz”
- If the index is none of the above, it should just print the value of the index as a string.

Write another program or function(s) that you can call to test the output of your program to validate that it behaves as expected. This function should have parameterized inputs so that you can test multiple scenarios

- Expected input that should output “Fizz”
- Expected input that should output “Buzz”
- Expected input that should output “FizzBuzz”
- Expected input that should output a number

If time permits, feel free to propose and/or add changes that would enhance this code.

## Rules
- If you’ve done this problem before, tell me! I won’t swap it out for another one, it just lets me know what to expect.
- You must share your screen for this exercise.
- You may search the Internet for syntax, library help, docs, etc. Just don’t search for the answer to this question!
- You may use whatever scripting language you want.
- Script(s) must be able to run from the command line in some way.
- You may use a text editor of your choice, as long as the script is running via command line. It doesn’t matter if the command line is embedded in your editor (ex. Visual Studio Code)
